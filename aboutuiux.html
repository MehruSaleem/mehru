<h2> About UIUX Designing </h2>

<p> UIUX is a vast and demanding field in market. Lots of people are now worling in this field. In start, I thought that UIUX designing is all 
  about designing screens. And then display. That's
  it. But now, when I explore more about UIUX designing,
  I found that UIUX desinign is not about just designing
  the screens, then connecting them and final presenting
  to others. Before designing any interface, we have to cover these steps & concepts:
<ul></ul>
<ui> Persona </ui>
<ui> Prototyping </ui>
<ui> Wireframes </ui>
<ui> Mood board </ui>
<ul></ul>
 After passing and covering these steps, user can finally design the interface , design screens and then display it.

<p> Moreover, software used for UIUX designing are: 
  <ul></ul>
<ui> Adobe xd </ui> 
<ui> Figma </ui> 
   <ul></ul>

</p> 
<ul></ul>
<p> Figma is commonly and most used software and tool for UIUX designing because: 
  <ul></ul>
<ui> Vast applications </ui> 
<ui> Flexibility </ui> 
<ui> Link updation </ui> 
<ui> Fast response </ui> 
   <ul></ul>
